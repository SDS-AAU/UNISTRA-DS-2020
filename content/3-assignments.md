# Assignment 1 (Network Analysis)

## Introduction

* In th first Part 2, you will replicate a well known network analysis, with different data and some twists. 
* Data: The data is to be found at: https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/raw/master/00_data/network_krackhard 

## Data: What do I get?

### Background
Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks. Time to give it a shot as well.
Krackhardt D. (1987). Cognitive social structures. Social Networks, 9, 104-134. The company manufactured high-tech equipment on the west coast of the United States and had just over 100 employees with 21 managers. Each manager was asked to whom do you go to for advice and who is your friend, to whom do you report was taken from company documents.
Description

The dataset includes 4 files - 3xKrack-High-Tec and 1x High-Tec-Attributes. Krack-High-Tec includes the following three 21x3 text matrices:

* ADVICE, directed, binary
* FRIENDSHIP, directed, binary
* REPORTS_TO, directed, binary

Column 1 contains the ID of the ego (from where the edge starts), and column 2 the alter (to which the edge goes). Column 3 indicates the presence (=1) or absence (=0) of an edge.

High-Tec-Attributes includes one 21x4 valued matrix.

* ID: Numeric ID of the manager
* AGE: The managers age (in years)
* TENURE: The length of service or tenure (in years)
* LEVEL: The level in the corporate hierarchy (coded 1,2 and 3; 1 = CEO, 2 = Vice President, 3 = manager)
* DEPT: The department (coded 1,2,3,4 with the CEO in department 0, ie not in a department)


## Tasks

### 1. Create a network

* Generate network objects for the companies organizational structure (reports to), friendship, advice
* This networks are generated from the corresponding edgelists
* Also attach node characteristics from the corresponding nodelist

### 2. Analysis

Make a little analysis on:

A: Network level characteristics. Find the overal network level of:

* Density
* Transistivity (Clustering Coefficient)
* Reciprocity

... for the different networks. Describe and interpret the results. Answer the following questions:

* Are relationships like friendship and advice giving usually reciprocal?
* Are friends of your friends also your friends?
* Are the employees generally more likely to be in a friendship or advice-seeking relationship?

B: Node level characteristics: Likewise, find out:

* Who is most popular in the networks. Who is the most wanted friend, and advice giver?
* Are managers in higher hirarchy more popular as friend, and advice giver?

C: Relational Characteristics: Answer the following questions:

* Are managers from the same 1. department, or on the same 2. hirarchy, 3. age, or 4. tenuere more likely to become friends or give advice? (hint: assortiativity related)
* Are friends more likely to give each others advice?


### 3. Visualization

Everything goes. Show us some pretty and informative plots. Choose what to plot, and how, on your own. Interpret the results and share some insights.

## Example solution

* [Minimal and barely commented solution notebook](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M2/exercises/nw_assignment_solution.nb.html): Shows you some fast and easy ways how to solve the assignment tasks. Doesn't explain a lot, but will help to get you started and/or check if you are on the right track. Please give it a shot on your own before, though :)

# Assignment 2 - NLP and Presidential Debate Tweets

Using the below data of tweets about the presidential debate in the US (autumn 2020) as well as the tweets of US Congress members by Party, we would like you to classify the debate-tweets into conservative vs. liberal. Using techniques learned in the course provide some insights about what most conservative the and most liberal posts are talking about...

- The data is gz-compressed JSON format - in Python pandas should not have issues opening it with `pd.read_json`, otherwise add `compression='gzip'` 

- in R:

```{% raw %}
library(jsonlite)
tmp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/raw/master/M2/data/pol_tweets.gz", tmp)

tweets_raw <- stream_in(gzfile(tmp, "pol_tweets")){% endraw %}
```

* 50k tweets from members/groups in the US Congress by Party (Rep:0, Dem:1: `https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/raw/master/M2/data/pol_tweets.gz`
* ~8k tweets on the 2020 presidential debate: `https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/raw/master/M2/data/pres_debate_2020.gz`

# Final Assignment NLP (graded)
### Introduction
In our sessions, online courses and assignments you learned how to work with text in different contexts and on various levels of aggregation. These skills allow you to access and process a vast range of data. 
Now itâ€™s time to get creative. We would like you to carry out an own analysis on a self-chosen topic (and on self-chosen data). This analysis should be interesting and informative and contain different elements natural language processing.


### Task description

#### Data & Problem identification

In this exercise, you are asked to choose and obtain a dataset you consider interesting and appropriate for the tasks required. 
You are welcome to use existing datasets e.g. [this repo](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets) you could also consider getting your own data (e.g. Twitter API, Instagram, news repositories etc.)

The data should be large enough and of proper granularity to be interesting for NLP techniques. If you are in doubt, please reach out.

What is expected from you:

* Identify an interesting problem that can be tackled using data science techniques applied to natural language.
* Select and obtain relevant data to do so.
* Clean and manipulate the data to make it useful.
* Carry out an exploratory data analysis to provide intuition into the content of the data, and interesting relationships to be found in it.
* Use unsupervised ML techniques to discover relationships within the data such as interesting topics.
* Use supervised ML techniques to create models that predict an outcome of interest.
* Document your workflow in a reconstructable manner.
* Report your findings in an accessible manner.

#### Analysis pipeline 

The analysis to be carried out by you has to contain elements of **data manipulation**, **exploration**, **unsupervised** and **supervised ML** as applied to **language data**.


* Definition of a problem statement and a short outline of the implementation 
* Description of data acquisition / how it was collected (by you or the publisher of the data) 
* Data preparation (general)
    * Data cleaning (if needed)
    * Recoding (label encoding, dummy creation etc.)
    * Merging and wrangling (if needed)
* Missing data imputation (if applicable and deemed relevant) 
* NLP - preparation
    * Extraction & Cleaning 
    * Tokenization
    * Filtering & Lemmatization / Stemming (if needed)
* NLP
    * EDA / simple frequency-based analysis
    * Simple vectorization (BoW, Tf-idf)
    * Topic modelling / Clustering (LDA / LSA)
* Supervised / Unsupervised ML
    * Try to link your results from network analysis or NLP with a more traditional ML problem.

**Many of the steps are optional.** So choose which methods you deem helpful and relevant to explore your chosen problem.

**Note:** Quality > Quantity. Consider which analysis, summarization, and visualization adds value. Excessive and unselective outputs (e.g. running 20 different models without providing a reason for, providing all possibilities of different plots without discussing and evaluating the insights gained from it) will not be considered helpful but rather distracting.

You are welcome to reuse code-elements from the course.

### Delivery and Format

Please work in groups of around 3 members on the assignment. The oral examination will be also conducted in a group setting.

You deliver a computational notebook as ipynb/rmd and HTML or PDF file by mail to Roman and Daniel. 
**Deadline for delivery 31/3**

If you want to host your project as a repo on GitHub, please do so (voluntary).

Let us know if you are interested in a (voluntary) seminar discussing your projects in April.
