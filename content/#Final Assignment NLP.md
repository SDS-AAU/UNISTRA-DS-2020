# Final Assignment NLP
#### Introduction
In our sessions, online courses and assignments you learned how to work with text in different contexts and on various levels of aggregation. These skills allow you to access and process a vast range of data. 
Now itâ€™s time to get creative. We would like you to carry out an own analysis on a self-chosen topic (and on self-chosen data). This analysis should be interesting and informative and contain different elements natural language processing.


### Task description

#### Data & Problem identification

In this exercise, you are asked to choose and obtain a dataset you consider interesting and appropriate for the tasks required. 
You are welcome to use existing datasets e.g. [this repo](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets) you could also consider getting your own data (e.g. Twitter API, Instagram, news repositories etc.)

The data should be large enough and of proper granularity to be interesting for NLP techniques. If you are in doubt, please reach out.

What is expected from you:

* Identify an interesting problem that can be tackled using data science techniques applied to natural language.
* Select and obtain relevant data to do so.
* Clean and manipulate the data to make it useful.
* Carry out an exploratory data analysis to provide intuition into the content of the data, and interesting relationships to be found in it.
* Use unsupervised ML techniques to discover relationships within the data such as interesting topics.
* Use supervised ML techniques to create models that predict an outcome of interest.
* Document your workflow in a reconstructable manner.
* Report your findings in an accessible manner.

#### Analysis pipeline 

The analysis to be carried out by you has to contain elements of **data manipulation**, **exploration**, **unsupervised** and **supervised ML** as applied to **language data**.


* Definition of a problem statement and a short outline of the implementation 
* Description of data acquisition / how it was collected (by you or the publisher of the data) 
* Data preparation (general)
    * Data cleaning (if needed)
    * Recoding (label encoding, dummy creation etc.)
    * Merging and wrangling (if needed)
* Missing data imputation (if applicable and deemed relevant) 
* NLP - preparation
    * Extraction & Cleaning 
    * Tokenization
    * Filtering & Lemmatization / Stemming (if needed)
* NLP
    * EDA / simple frequency-based analysis
    * Simple vectorization (BoW, Tf-idf)
    * Topic modelling / Clustering (LDA / LSA)
* Supervised / Unsupervised ML
    * Try to link your results from network analysis or NLP with a more traditional ML problem.

**Many of the steps are optional.** So choose which methods you deem helpful and relevant to explore your chosen problem.

**Note:** Quality > Quantity. Consider which analysis, summarization, and visualization adds value. Excessive and unselective outputs (e.g. running 20 different models without providing a reason for, providing all possibilities of different plots without discussing and evaluating the insights gained from it) will not be considered helpful but rather distracting.

You are welcome to reuse code-elements from the course.

### Delivery and Format

Please work in groups of around 3 members on the assingnment. The oral examination will be also conducted in a group setting.

You deliver a computational notebook as ipynb/rmd and HTML or PDF file by mail to Roman and Daniel. 
**Deadline for delivery 31/3**

Oral examination: 8/4 - morning. Exam plan distributed after deadline.
